Should you wish to host your own server: this modpack has been configured to work with simple voice chat and given a compatibility layer for the velocity proxy.

## Known Issues

### Resource Pack Order

Sometimes upon pack updates new resource packs will be introduced which will be in a different order for different users. This causes some features like texture pack enhancements and item wheels to use their default configuration. This is a Mojang problem as the resource pack list is stored in the `options.txt` which I do not want to overwrite every update. I am working on a solution to this issue.

Workaround: when you notice an update occur go to your `Options->Resource Packs` and make sure `kenziepack` is always on top using the arrows on the icons.
